# Frontend - React ⚛️
All code is located under /frontend. <br>
As advised per the project requirements we used React & Material-UI.<br>
To run it install the packages inside the package.json, via your package manager of choice and run it.<br>
NodeJS comes with the Node Package Manager, which will install all missing dependencies from the package.json file<br>

```
cd /frontend 
npm install 
npm start
```
